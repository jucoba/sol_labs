#Key takeawys.

the cNTF is about 1000 times cheaper than an SPL NFT.
A merkle tree account is needed, the rent for that accounts depends on the size and this is determined by the nÃºmber of nft you need  (maxdepth and max buffer size) the number of NFT that can be holded is 2 pow max depth
cNFT metadata is stored on the ledger, to get it you need a RPC provider. It has monthly costs.
You can transfer cNFT, it just change lead owner in the mapple tree, the cNFT remains in you mapple tree account 

#Need to be solved
Pending to validate id there is a way to transfer the cNFT to another mapple account

How can this not being a centraliced solution given than for fetching the token the merkle tree account public Id must be known?
=> With the method getAssetByOwner there is no need to know neither the mapple tree account nor the assetID

How to get the change history of the token metadada.
