**Key takeawys.

the cNTF is about 1000 times cheaper than an SPL NFT.
A mapple tree account is needed, the rent for that accounts depends on the size and this is determined by the n√∫mber of nft you need  (maxdepth and max buffer size) the number of NFT that can be holded is 2 pow max depth
cNFT metadata is stored on the ledger, to get it you need a RPC provider. It has monthly costs.
You can transfer cNFT, it just change lead owner in the mapple tree, the cNFT remains in you mapple tree account (Pending to validate id there is a way to transfer the cNFT to another mapple account)
